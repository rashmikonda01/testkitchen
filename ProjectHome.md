A testing framework combining dbdeploy, dbunit, and Pentaho PDI so you can manage changes to the DB schema and transformations and ensure they still produce the expected output. You can create mock data that will be loaded into your staging database, and then create "golden data" to represent your expected outcomes. After a transformation is ran you can compare to two to decide if the test passes or fails.
